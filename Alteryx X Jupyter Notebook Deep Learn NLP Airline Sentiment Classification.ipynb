    "A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values.\n",

    "\n",
    "A one hot encoding allows the representation of categorical data to be more expressive.\n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "Given dataset contains data of tweets on various airline’s twitter handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains a total of 12 columns, out of which one column specifies the sentiment of the tweet. All other columns provide various information related to what was the tweet, where was it posted from, when was it posted, it's retweeted; etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we goes into the real data analysis. It's crucial to understand what's the difference between traditional NLP & deep learning based NLP technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with encoding. If audience have the experience, jump to Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.2 Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "A one hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, each integer value is represented as a binary vector that is all zero values except the index of the integer, which is marked with a 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use a One Hot Encoding?\n",
    "\n",
    "A one hot encoding allows the representation of categorical data to be more expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. The categories must be converted into numbers. This is required for both input and output variables that are categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer Encoding\n",
    "We could use an integer encoding directly, rescaled where needed. This may work for problems where there is a natural ordinal relationship between the categories, and in turn the integer values, such as labels for temperature ‘cold’, warm’, and ‘hot’.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.3 Encode with Sckit Learn\n",
    "Now that we have seen how to roll our own one hot encoding from scratch, let’s see how we can use the scikit-learn library to perform this mapping automatically for cases where the input sequence fully captures the expected range of input values:\n",
    "\n",
    "cold, cold, warm, cold, hot, hot, warm, cold, warm, hot\n",
    "\n",
    "from ayx import Alteryx\n",
    "\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "from numpy import argmax\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\n",
    "# define example\n",
    "data = ['cold', 'cold', 'warm', 'cold', 'hot', 'hot', 'warm', 'cold', 'warm', 'hot']\n",
    "values = array(data)\n",
    "print(values)\n",
    "# integer encode\n",
    "label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\n",
    "integer_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(values)\n",
    "print(integer_encoded)\n",
    "# binary encode\n",
    "onehot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)\n",
    "integer_encoded = integer_encoded.reshape(len(integer_encoded), 1)\n",
    "onehot_encoded = onehot_encoder.fit_transform(integer_encoded)\n",
    "print(onehot_encoded)\n",
    "# invert first example\n",
    "inverted = label_encoder.inverse_transform([argmax(onehot_encoded[0, :])])\n",
    "print(inverted)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.4 One Hot Encoding with Kera \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have a sequence that is already integer encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could work with the integers directly, after some scaling. Alternately, you can one hot encode the integers directly. This is important to consider if the integers do not have a real ordinal relationship and are really just placeholders for labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras library offers a function called to_categorical() that you can use to one hot encode integer data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have 4 integer values [0, 1, 2, 3] and we have the input sequence of the following 10 numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "from numpy import array\n",
    "from numpy import argmax\n",
    "from keras.utils import to_categorical\n",
    "# define example\n",
    "data = [1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "data = array(data)\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "# one hot encode\n",
    "encoded = to_categorical(data)\n",
    "print(encoded)\n",
    "# invert encoding\n",
    "inverted = argmax(encoded[0])\n",
    "print(inverted)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.5 Vectorize Text with Count & TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Word Counts with CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The CountVectorizer provides a simple way to both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words, but also to encode new documents using that vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an instance of the CountVectorizer class.\n",
    "Call the fit() function in order to learn a vocabulary from one or more documents.\n",
    "Call the transform() function on one or more documents as needed to encode each as a vector.\n",
    "An encoded vector is returned with a length of the entire vocabulary and an integer count for the number of times each word appeared in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these vectors will contain a lot of zeros, we call them sparse. Python provides an efficient way of handling sparse vectors in the scipy.sparse package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vectors returned from a call to transform() will be sparse vectors, and you can transform them back to numpy arrays to look and better understand what is going on by calling the toarray() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of using the CountVectorizer to tokenize, build a vocabulary, and then encode a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "# list of text documents\n",
    "text = [\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\"]\n",
    "# create the transform\n",
    "vectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n",
    "# tokenize and build vocab\n",
    "vectorizer.fit(text)\n",
    "# summarize\n",
    "print(vectorizer.vocabulary_)\n",
    "# encode document\n",
    "vector = vectorizer.transform(text)\n",
    "# summarize encoded vector\n",
    "print(vector.shape)\n",
    "print(type(vector))\n",
    "print(vector.toarray())\n",
    "\n",
    "print(vectorizer.vocabulary_)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TF-IDF Vectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Word counts are a good starting point, but are very basic.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with simple counts is that some words like “the” will appear many times and their large counts will not be very meaningful in the encoded vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative is to calculate word frequencies, and by far the most popular method is called TF-IDF. This is an acronym than stands for “Term Frequency – Inverse Document” Frequency which are the components of the resulting scores assigned to each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.\n",
    "Without going into the math, TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TfidfVectorizer will tokenize documents, learn the vocabulary and inverse document frequency weightings, and allow you to encode new documents. Alternately, if you already have a learned CountVectorizer, you can use it with a TfidfTransformer to just calculate the inverse document frequencies and start encoding documents.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Word Embedding Model\n",
    "Recently, the field of natural language processing has been moving away from bag-of-word models and word encoding toward word embeddings. The bene\f",
    "t of word embeddings is that they encode each word into a dense vector that captures something about its relative meaning within the training text. This means that variations of words like case, spelling, punctuation, and so on will automatically be learned to be similar in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embedding is an approach to provide a ** dense vector representation ** of words that capture\n",
    "something about their meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are an improvement over simpler bag-of-word\n",
    "model word encoding schemes like word counts and frequencies that result in ** large and sparse\n",
    "vectors (mostly 0 values) ** that describe documents but not the meaning of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings work by using an algorithm to train a set of ** fixed-length dense ** and\n",
    "** continuous-valued vectors ** based on a large corpus of text. Each word is represented by a\n",
    "point in the embedding space and these points are learned and moved around based on the\n",
    "words that surround the target word. \n",
